# Guess the Number


## Introduction
"Guess the Number" is a simple two-player game where each player tries to guess a randomly chosen number between 0 and 100. The game provides hints to help players get closer to the correct number. The first player to guess the number correctly wins, or if both guess it at the same time, it results in a tie.

## Features

## How to Play
1. The computer randomly selects a number between 0 and 100.
